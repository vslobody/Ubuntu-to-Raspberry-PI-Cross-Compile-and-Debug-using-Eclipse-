# Ubuntu to RaspberryPI Cross Compile and Debug using Eclipse
## Introduction
Some time ago I have encountered the need to develop similarly straighforward code for Raspberyy Pi platform. After a little bit of back and forth considerations between python and C++, I have chosen to experiment with C++ option.
The next iteration of decisions was whether to do development on the Raspberry Pi platform itself, or on the Ubuntu box and then cross compile code for Raspberry PI. My choice was to do development on Ubuntu, since Ubuntu is much more powerfull machine than Raspberry Pi.
In terms of IDE, my default choice is Eclipse. Obviously, there are many great IDEs out there - Visual Studio, Clion to name a few, but I like Eclipse. Last but not the least - we will use CMake.
## Acknowledgments. 
This is derived work inspired, primarily, by [this excellent guide](https://tttapa.github.io/Pages/Raspberry-Pi/C++-Development-RPiOS/) and many other distinguished contributors. Where possible, I will provide links to the original source, so that the reader can investigate further on their own, if required.
## Preliminaries
In this repository, we will reference to the **host** machine - Ubuntu box, which we will use for all types of code development, and **target** machine - Raspberry PI box - this is where we want to run the code (eventually).
### Hardware
#### Host machine
Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
#### Target machine
[GeeekPi Raspberry Pi 4 8GB Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LYP7QH3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with [Seeed Studio ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076SSR1W1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [GPS Module GPS NEO-6M](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P8YMVNT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Longer term plans include subsequent development using this equipment
