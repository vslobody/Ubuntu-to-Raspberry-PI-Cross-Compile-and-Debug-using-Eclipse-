# Ubuntu-to-Raspberry-PI-Cross-Compile-and-Debug-using-Eclipse-
Some time ago I have encountered the need to develop similarly straighforward code for Raspberyy Pi platform. After a little bit back and forth considerations between python and C++, I have chosen to experiment with C++ option.
The next iteration of decisions was whether to do development on the Raspberry Pi platform itself, or on the Ubuntu box and then cross compile code for Raspberry PI. My choice was to do development on Ubuntu, since Ubuntu is much more powerfull machine than Raspberry Pi.
